# CS 273B Final Project

**Title:**
Predicting regulatory activities from massively parallel reporter assays

**Description:**
 In a reporter assay, a short piece of DNA sequence is inserted in front of a common reporter gene. This construct is then put into cells and the expression of the reporter gene measures the effect of the DNA sequence in activating or repressing expression. Very recent works used a large number of reporter assays in parallel to measure the effects of candidate regulatory sequences. The goal of this project is to train a deep learning model based on the data generated by these massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) in order to accurately predict the tissue specific effects of regulatory DNA. Then interpret the models and use them to obtain in-silico scores for mutations/variants.
